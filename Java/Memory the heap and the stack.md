# Memory: the heap and the stack
# The heap
Holds objects and their variables (instance variables)
# The stack
Holds methods and the local/stack variables. At the bottom is the oldest method, at the top the current one with the current line and the value of the local variables. 
All local variables live on the stack, in the frame corresponding to the method where they are declared.
