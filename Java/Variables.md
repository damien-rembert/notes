# Variables

# Naming conventions
Mixed case with a lowercase first letter., internal words start with capital letters.
One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary "throwaway" variables. Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.


# creating a variable:
typeOfTheVar name = value;

# creating an instance of a class:
nameOfTheClass nameOfTheInstance = new nameOfTheClass();

# Relationship with Class
Classes are blueprints
Classes have instances (objects)
Objects contains state (fields/state/variables/data?) and behaviours (methods)
A class defines the attributes of objects, i.e., the information related to them (instance variables), and their commands, i.e., their methods. The values of instance (i.e., object) variables define the internal state of an individual object, whereas methods define the functionality it offers.
