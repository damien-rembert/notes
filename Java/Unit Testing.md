Unit test writing begins by creating a test class, which is created under the Test-Packages folder. When testing the Calculator class, the test class is to be called CalculatorTest. The string Test at the end of the name tells the programming environment that this is a test class. Without the string Test, the tests in the class will not be executed. (Note: Tests are created in NetBeans under the Test Packages folder.)

The test class CalculatorTest is initially empty.
