# HashSet

In Java, sets always contain either 0 or 1 amounts of any given object. As an example, the set interface is implemented by HashSet.


# hashset operations


# methods needed
for a class to be put in a HashSet, we need to define for it:
    the equals method, so that all equal or approximately equal objects cause the comparison to return true and all false for all the rest
    the hashCode method, so that as few objects as possible end up with the same hash value
