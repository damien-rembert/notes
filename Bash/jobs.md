# jobs

## advice
add & at the end of the line to make jobs start in background
use it to edit multiple files (nano file1 => ctrl+Z => nano file2 => ctrl+Z => jobs => fg 1)


## shortcuts
ctrl+Z = suspend and put in background

## behaviour

## commands

cmd1 || cmd2		run cmd2 after cmd1 if 1 wasn't successful 
cmd1 && cmd2		run cmd2 after cmd1 if 1 was successful
cmd1; cmd2			run cmd2 after cmd1
cmd1 &				run cmd 1 in background
